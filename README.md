# PacmanOS
An aarch64 operating system / hypervisor targetting the M1 chip, designed for architectural analysis

Writing some bare metal rust code that runs on M1

The linker script and infrastructure come from the [m1n1 project](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1)

Thanks to Hector and the Asahi Linux team for their wonderful detailed reverse engineering of the M1 boot process!
